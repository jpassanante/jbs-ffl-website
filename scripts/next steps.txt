Next steps:
Review the data — check a few JSON files to verify accuracy
Create a transformation script — convert the ESPN data into the format your website needs (e.g., update champions.js with playoff results, extract head-to-head records, etc.)
Update your website — use the transformed data to populate pages like All-Time Records, Head-to-Head, etc.
